- Potential issue with theme changer still?
  - Update: Nah, doesn't exist on dev
  - UPDATE: ACTUALLY ISSUE OCCURS using private browser!
  - Okay, finally fixed?
    - added check of `theme` and `resolvedTheme` in `ThemeChanger`
    - `localStorage.theme === "null"` is still buggy, but shouldn't occur in real world anyway
    - Deploying to test now...
    - To test:
      - open site in private browsing window
      - use theme toggle
      - clear localstorage, change system ui theme
      - try again

- Kind of fixed using `MenuLink` component, which wraps a link in a button with `tabIndex` set to `-1`
- Tabbing to item works, and when clicked / activated (using keyboard), navigates to page and hides popover
- Deleting `WrappedNextLink` as we don't need it.

### Original

- ATM it kind of works, but I think there is an issue with tab focus styling in dark mode
- [ ] to get popover to close when a next link is clicked, had to use ugly workaround:
